OCI Scripts using python SDK to administer resources

### Execute an Script

* Move to the folder where the script resides 
* Rename the **.env.example** file into **.env**
* Fill the required values inside the **.env** file
* Install the packages inside the Requirements.txt file
* Execute the script by running `python <name_of_the_script>.py` (In case you have python3 as your default python) or `python3 <name_of_the_script>.py`

**NOTE** As a best practice use virtual environments

```
python -m venv ocisdk
```
